# JNP1
MIMUW University Assignments - JNP1 C++

Course in C++17 programming.

# Task 1
Road tolls counter. Main theme/difficulty: Parsing the input with regexes.

# Task 2
Managing sets of encrypted strings. Main theme/difficulty: Static Initialization Fiasco (SIF) and interfacing with libraries written in C.

# Task 3
Position, Vector, Rectangle and Rectangles classes. Main theme/difficulty: C++ class features, proper use of std::move and move semantics.

# Task 4
Simulating computer executing programs written in Template Assembly (TAsm), which is a subset of ASM based on C++ templates. Main theme/difficulty: template metaprogramming, templated generic lambdas, variable templates, compile-time programming using constexpr functions.

# Task 5
Template class for storing functions between generic types A and V allowing for fast iteration over local maximas. The only thing known about A and V was that their destructors would not throw and that operator< was provided for both of them (which, in turn, could throw). Main theme/difficulty: providing strong exception safety and copy-on-write semantics.

# Task 6
Simulating computer executing programs written in Object Oriented Assembly (OOAsm). Main theme/difficulty: proper class design, using polymorphism.

# Task 7
Partly functional library for drawing piecewise Bezier cubic curves. Main theme/difficulty: functional programming, composing functions.
